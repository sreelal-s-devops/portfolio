## Projects
- **Book Review System**: 
I developed a book review app that allows users to review and rate books, incorporating full CRUD operations and secure user authentication using Laravel Breeze. The app features various database relationships, including one-to-one (each book has one review), one-to-many (users can write multiple reviews), and has-many-through (users view reviews through books). It includes functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting books and reviews, as well as a star rating system for average ratings. Review details, including reviewer information and timestamps, are displayed. Validation is handled through FormRequest, and pagination is used to manage reviews efficiently. The app is designed with responsive Blade templates.
- **Job Portal System**:
 Iâ€™m currently developing a job portal system using Laravel to enhance my skills with the framework. The project features comprehensive user management, allowing job seekers to create profiles, browse job listings, and apply for positions, while employers can post job vacancies and manage applications. It includes robust filtering by job name, maximum salary, and minimum salary, and supports CV uploads by job seekers. The system also offers secure authentication, a user-friendly interface, and responsive Blade templates
